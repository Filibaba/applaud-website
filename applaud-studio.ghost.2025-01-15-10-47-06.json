On top of a well-thought out user interface and easy-to-understand flows. \n\nIf you need help building out your app universe — reach out!","feature_image":"https://applaud.ghost.io/content/images/2024/02/Tomat-grow-2_0047.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-02-28T11:42:02.000Z","updated_at":"2024-02-29T14:01:32.000Z","published_at":"2024-02-29T10:31:16.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"65e1de6f4d6dac00010184e1","uuid":"123d8c81-3bb6-4deb-8a09-29ef4324480d","title":"Sometimes, a Button Just Wants to Look Like a Button","slug":"s","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"How much was really lost in the great calamity that was iOS 7?

The button also has a plus symbol, adding one more signifier to it.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption\" data-kg-thumbnail=\"https://blog.applaudstud.io/content/media/2024/03/Phone-shape-2_thumb.jpg\" data-kg-custom-thumbnail=\"\">\n            <div class=\"kg-video-container\">\n                <video src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2024/03/Phone-shape-2.mp4\" poster=\"https://img.spacergif.org/v1/1892x1772/0a/spacer.png\" width=\"1892\" height=\"1772\" loop=\"\" autoplay=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" preload=\"metadata\" style=\"background: transparent url('__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2024/03/Phone-shape-2_thumb.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;\"></video>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-overlay\">\n                    <button class=\"kg-video-large-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                            <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                        </svg>\n                    </button>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-player-container kg-video-hide\">\n                    <div class=\"kg-video-player\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Pause video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <rect x=\"3\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                                <rect x=\"14\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <span class=\"kg-video-current-time\">0:00</span>\n                        <div class=\"kg-video-time\">\n                            /<span class=\"kg-video-duration\">0:05</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-seek-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"0\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-playback-rate\" aria-label=\"Adjust playback speed\">1×</button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-unmute-icon\" aria-label=\"Unmute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Mute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-volume-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"100\">\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <figcaption><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Handla grocery shopping list prototype</span></p></figcaption>\n        </figure><p>When you tap it, it morphs into the next primary button, a send button. </p><p>But shouldn't it be disabled when there's no text entered? iOS dictates that this is how a button should work after all. But actually, an active button is more accessible since a user may not always know what enables a button (in this case text entry). It's better to have a button always be active, and provide the user with an error message if they tap it without having completed all of the requirements. This is a general rule of thumb a usability guru once taught me. </p><p>In this case the entry field shakes to bring attention to itself. To be even more accessible it could highlight the placeholder text along with a message, but I felt it would be too much for this particular case. </p><p>I like that this button is similar in style to the Search button on the iOS Home Screen. And it's a nice mirrored shape to the Dynamic Island.</p><p>Straying away from buttons for a bit, another favorite of mine are sliders. Harking back to the magical Slide to Unlock that sold us on the iPhone in the first place, sliders can also be very satisfying when used appropriately.</p><p>In the <a href=\"https://flourish.garden\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Flourish Garden</a> app, I used sliders to make the onboarding flow more engaging.

For a UI designer like myself, quite a lot. I wandered around aimlessly for some time before finding my footing again. There was something so tangible with using real world metaphors for digital interfaces.\n\nModern design languages offer a lot of flexibility with their focus on fundamentals like typography, white space and simplistic icons. But sometimes, using an old school real world metaphor adds a lot of delight to an experience.\n\nFor example, a really tactile looking button can be so satisfying. With the addition of sounds and haptics, they can be really convincing, too.\n\nThis settings toggle is a way to present two opposing options, such as Metric or US measurements. In the case of the meal planning app Plantry, this fits in with the cooking theme since the button alludes to kitchen appliances. Even with the overall minimalism of a screen like this, a tactile button still fits. And it adds a lot of delight to an otherwise boring choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:04\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I get it. You feel like skeumorphism is not something we do any more. You wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.\n\nJust having a shape around your button goes a long way to communicate that it's a button. And having it be a flat (or gradiented) shape lets you lean into digital benefits of changing shapes without breaking the mental model of a button.\n\nFor the shopping list app Handla, I made this prototype that puts a primary bottom button within easy reach of your thumb. It uses a shape fill along with a diffuse shadow to give you the feeling that it's lifted off of the background layer. The progressive blur on the background increases this feeling and makes it feel like it's in focus. The trick here is not to overdo the blur effect or it can be distracting. The button also has a plus symbol, adding one more signifier to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:05\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you tap it, it morphs into the next primary button, a send button.\n\nBut shouldn't it be disabled when there's no text entered? iOS dictates that this is how a button should work after all. But actually, an active button is more accessible since a user may not always know what enables a button (in this case text entry). It's better to have a button always be active, and provide the user with an error message if they tap it without having completed all of the requirements. This is a general rule of thumb a usability guru once taught me.\n\nIn this case the entry field shakes to bring attention to itself. To be even more accessible it could highlight the placeholder text along with a message, but I felt it would be too much for this particular case.\n\nI like that this button is similar in style to the Search button on the iOS Home Screen. And it's a nice mirrored shape to the Dynamic Island.\n\nStraying away from buttons for a bit, another favorite of mine are sliders. Harking back to the magical Slide to Unlock that sold us on the iPhone in the first place, sliders can also be very satisfying when used appropriately.\n\nIn the Flourish Garden app, I used sliders to make the onboarding flow more engaging. The slider affects the screen itself which adds understanding and makes the experience more immersive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:05\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally I want to share this animation for Quill. It solves a common problem on team messaging services where the discussions wanders off and you want to retroactively move messages into a new thread. The physical metaphor of a stack of messages is both easy to understand and allowed for a very satisfying animation when rolling up several messages into a thread.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:05\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat UI in your app could be solved better using a real world metaphor, or with just a really nice button?\n\nIf you need help crafting delightful experience for your app, don't hesitate to reach out!","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Full-HD@2x-1.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-03-01T13:55:59.000Z","updated_at":"2024-03-19T16:00:11.000Z","published_at":"2024-03-06T17:55:05.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"65def3fac25a190008fa5b9a","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"65e9c7690bf0ae00018cc356","uuid":"5fda8715-77f0-4279-aba1-e33c479ba4bc","title":"The Headless App","slug":"the-headless-app","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Back in the day, a decade ago, when I made websites on the daily the term headless CMS was starting to become popular.

Consistency is great. However, I would argue that design systems are meant to be broken. You work within the system to keep delivering what you know works, or what someone else has deemed works. But for it to remain healthy, teams need to have the possibility to break the system. To question decisions that have been made.\n\nGreat apps and products can stand on top of a system and make opinionated decisions that break the mold. If done correctly, such an app will still feel at home even if it’s not following all the guidelines.\n\nIf a pattern is successfully broken into something new, it can result in refreshed guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0:00\n\n/0:03\n\n\n1×\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll use Apple as a very public example of this. Their Human Interface Guidelines serve as a design system across their platforms.\n\nA recent example of one of Apple's own apps that doesn't strictly follow their guidelines is Apple Sports. It has rounded buttons in the navigation bar and a segmented controller for picking match day that has been styled to be completely text based.

The idea for the app icon was clear from the beginning. Depict a simple and iconic item related to serving food; a bowl. The bowl itself was modeled in 3D and is a sphere sliced in half, sitting at an angle. The first versions came straight out of a 3D render. Eventually it was redrawn inside of Sketch for a more illustrated look. It was then tweaked to increase the sense of depth. Even though it's very harmonic, the white bowl on yellow didn't stand out so well when browsing the App Store. So an inverted version was made. And most recently we went the simplistic route of using the glyph version of the bowl — still based on that original 3D perspective.

Getting a great app icon for your app can be a process. Even with a clear idea in mind, you'll need to iterate.

The idea for the app icon was clear from the beginning. Depict a simple and iconic item related to serving food; a bowl. The bowl itself was modeled in 3D and is a sphere sliced in half, sitting at an angle. The first versions came straight out of a 3D render. Eventually it was redrawn inside of Sketch for a more illustrated look. It was then tweaked to increase the sense of depth. Even though it's very harmonic, the white bowl on yellow didn't stand out so well when browsing the App Store. So an inverted version was made. And most recently we went the simplistic route of using the glyph version of the bowl — still based on that original 3D perspective. To make it interesting a classic method of angular gradients is used to make it look almost golden.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Plantry-1.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1288\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/Plantry-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/Plantry-1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Plantry-1.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>An icon is never seen in isolation of course.
