      	<p>During our collaboration on the new app for our client, Mind Vault, we designed an icon that, unfortunately, wasn't ultimately utilized due to the company's shift in direction, which even involved a name change! If we had proceeded with this icon, our focus would have been on further refining the MV word-mark for enhanced clarity and impact. An interesting observation about the word-mark is its cool side effect: when the text is highlighted in macOS OCR recognition, it accurately identifies it as 'MV', showcasing its distinctiveness and effectiveness.</p>
